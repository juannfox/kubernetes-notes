# Kubeastronaut notes

This is a series of notes (dated 2025), concepts and ideas on the topic of Kubernetes, written by a DevOps engineer on their road to completion of the Kubeastronaut certification path (which includes KCNA, KCNS, CKAD, CKA and CKS certifications).

A previous version of thi document, dated 2022 (back when I took my first CKA exam), is also [available on this repository](2022-cka-notes-es.md), but written in Spanish and authored by a less experienced version of myself.

## Epilogue

My name is Juan Fox, from Argentina, and as of today (August 2025), when I start jotting down these notes, I am a Certified Kubernetes Administrator with around 4 years of experience with this software, and around 8 years in IT. For a while now, I've been wanting to deepen my knowledge of Kubernetes, this career-changing platform that I love, and the Kubeastronaut certification pack is a great and ambitious way to do that.

## Containers

*Containers* are one of the core components of **Kubernetes** and I expand on these in the [Containers section](containers.md).

## Auto-scaling

This section covers automatic *scaling*, a trait (and kindness) of Kubernetes that allows for elastic workloads, at both the cluster and pod levels:
